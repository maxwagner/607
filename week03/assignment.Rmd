Loading the data in from the csv file.
```{r}
library(RCurl)
library(plyr)
dat <- data.frame(read.csv("agaricus-lepiota.data.csv", header = FALSE))
```

Picking columns to show and renaming the columns.
```{r}
mushrooms <- subset(dat, select = c(1, 2, 5, 9))
colnames(mushrooms) <- c("Poisonous", "Cap_Shape", "Bruises", "Gill_Size")
```

Renaming the abbreviations to something a little better with "plyr"
```{r}
mushrooms$Poisonous <- revalue(mushrooms$Poisonous, c("p" = "poisonous", "e" = "edible"))
mushrooms$Cap_Shape <- revalue(mushrooms$Cap_Shape, c("b" = "bell", "c" = "conical", "x" = "convex", 
                                                      "f" = "flat", "k" = "knobbed", "s" = "sunken"))
mushrooms$Bruises <- revalue(mushrooms$Bruises, c("t" = "yes", "f" = "no"))
mushrooms$Gill_Size <- revalue(mushrooms$Gill_Size, c("b" = "broad", "n" = "narrow"))
```

Testing to see if the data frame looks the way I want it to.
```{r}
mushrooms[1:10,1:4]
```
