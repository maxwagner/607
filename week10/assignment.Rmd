Query the science top stories API, and get the results section only into an data frame. Then do a little head view of just the title column.
```{r message=FALSE}
library(jsonlite)
nyt_j <- fromJSON("http://api.nytimes.com/svc/topstories/v1/science.json?api-key=17068d0e51d2b2dbcbc67410171d1146:10:73350860")
nyt_j <- data.frame(nyt_j$results)

head(nyt_j$title)
```
